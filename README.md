## Niche-Specific Themes
HivePress comes with a free [ListingHive](https://hivepress.io/themes/listinghive/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github.com) theme that is fully compatible with HivePress and its official extensions. Also, there are a few [premium themes](https://hivepress.io/themes/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github.com) with more tailored design and functionality for various directory and marketplace niches.

## Developer Features
If you have at least basic coding skills, then look no further because HivePress is powered by the most customizable and extensible [framework](https://docs.hivepress.io/developer-docs/) for directory websites:

- **Structured Code** - We follow the WordPress coding standards, so the codebase is well-structured and readable.

- **Hooks API** - A collection of actions and filters for customizing or extending the core HivePress functionality.
- **REST API** - There’s an API endpoint for every action, so you can integrate HivePress with third-party platforms.
