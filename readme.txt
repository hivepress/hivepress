This plugin comes with all the essential features for building a directory website to allow users easily add, manage and search listings:

- **Listing Categories** - Add categories for different listing types.
- **Custom Fields** - Add custom fields to the listing form.
- **Search Filters** - Turn any custom field into a search filter.
- **Location Search** - Enable the location-based listing search.
- **Ratings & Reviews** - Allow users to leave reviews for listings.
- **Private Messages** - Allow users to send private messages.
- **Favorite Listings** - Allow users to keep a list of favorite listings.

Crucial features like **user registration**, **listing moderation**, and **captcha protection** are also available by default.

Moreover, if you ever need to customize any of the HivePress **page templates** or **email notifications**, you can do this without coding skills using the familiar WordPress editor.

= Monetization Options =
With HivePress, you can create a business, not just a website. There are at least a few ways to monetize your directory, for example:

- **Paid Listings** - Charge users for adding listings.
- **Featured Listings** - Charge users for advertising listings.
- **Claim Listings** - Charge companies for claiming their listings.

= Free & Premium Extensions =
Enhance your website functionality with just a few clicks using HivePress extensions. While you can build a fully functional directory using free extensions only, [premium extensions](https://hivepress.io/extensions/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org) may also be useful depending on your website requirements.

= Niche-Specific Themes =
HivePress comes with a free [ListingHive](https://hivepress.io/themes/listinghive/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org) theme that is fully compatible with HivePress and its official extensions. Also, there are a few [premium themes](https://hivepress.io/themes/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org) with more tailored design and functionality for various directory and marketplace niches.

= Developer Features =
If you have at least basic coding skills, then look no further because HivePress is powered by a highly customizable and extensible [framework](https://docs.hivepress.io/developer-docs/) for directory websites:

- **Structured Code** - We follow the WordPress coding standards, so the codebase is well-structured and readable.
- **Easy Theming** - Styling and overriding layouts is very intuitive due to block-based templates and BEM CSS notation.
- **Hooks API** - A collection of actions and filters for customizing or extending the core HivePress functionality.
- **REST API** - There’s an API endpoint for every action, so you can integrate HivePress with third-party platforms.
- **Docs & Snippets** - Never get stuck with our collection of ready-made code snippets, API references, and docs.

= Support & Community =
HivePress is directly supported by its developers, people who know the plugin inside and out, so any issues are resolved in the optimal way possible. Join the [community](https://community.hivepress.io/) to report a bug, suggest a feature, or vote for suggestions to help us make HivePress better!
